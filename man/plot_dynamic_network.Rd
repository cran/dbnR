\title{Plots a dynamic Bayesian network in a hierarchical way}
\usage{
plot_dynamic_network(
  structure,
  offset = 200,
  subset_nodes = NULL,
  reverse = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{structure}{the structure or fit of the network.}

\item{offset}{the blank space between time slices}

\item{subset_nodes}{a vector containing the names of the subset of nodes to plot}

\item{reverse}{reverse to the classic naming convention of the nodes. 
The oldest time-slice will now be t_0 and the most recent one t_n. 
Only for visualization purposes, the network is unmodified underneath. If
using subset_nodes, remember that t_0 is now the oldest time-slice.}

\value{
the visualization of the DBN
}
\description{
To plot the DBN, this method first computes a hierarchical structure
for a time slice and replicates it for each slice. Then, it calculates the
relative position of each node with respect to his equivalent in the first
slice. The result is a net where each time slice is ordered and separated
from one another, where the leftmost slice is the oldest and the rightmost
represents the present time. This function is also called by the generic
plot function of "dbn" and "dbn.fit" S3 objects.

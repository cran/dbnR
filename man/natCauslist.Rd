\title{This file contains all the classes needed for the natPSOHO structure learning 
algorithm. It was implemented as an independent package in
https://github.com/dkesada/natPSOHO and then merged into dbnR. All the original
source files are merged into one to avoid bloating the R/ folder of the
package.}
\arguments{
\item{ordering}{a vector with the names of the nodes in t_0}

\item{ordering_raw}{a vector with the names of the nodes without the appended "_t_0"}
}
\value{
A new 'natCauslist' object
}
\description{
Constructor of the 'natCauslist' class
}
\details{
The classes are now not exported because the whole algorithm is 
encapsulated inside the package and only the resulting dbn structure is
wanted. As a result, many security checks have been omitted.
R6 class that defines causal lists in the PSO

The causal lists will be the base of the positions and the velocities
in the pso part of the algorithm. They will not have the same structure
as their binary counterparts, but their class skeleton will serve as a
base.

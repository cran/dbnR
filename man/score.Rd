\usage{
score(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a "bn" or "dbn" object}

\item{...}{additional parameters}

\value{
the score of the network

\description{
Generic method for computing the score of a BN or a DBN.
Calls bnlearn's \code{\link{nodes}} underneath. 
I have to redefine the generic and mask the original for it to work on both 
bn and dbn objects without the user having to import bnlearn.

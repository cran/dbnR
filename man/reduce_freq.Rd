\title{Reduce the frequency of the time series data in a data.table}
\usage{
reduce_freq(dt, obj_freq, curr_freq, id_var = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{the original data.table}

\item{obj_freq}{the desired number of seconds between rows}

\item{curr_freq}{the number of seconds between rows in the original dataset}

\item{id_var}{optional variable that labels different time series in a dataset, to avoid averaging values from different processes}
}
\value{
the data.table with the desired frequency
}
\description{
In a time series dataset, there is a time difference between one row and the 
next one. This function reduces the number of rows from its current frequency
to the desired one. Instead of the frequency in Hz, the number of seconds
between rows is asked (Hz = 1/s).

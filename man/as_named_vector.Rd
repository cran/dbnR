\description{
Given a single row data.table, convert it into a named vector. Used in the
mvn_inference, to obtain an evidence named vector. For this case, the 
data.table should contain only the evidence that we want to provide. If a
named vector is provided instead of a data.table, nothing will be done and
the named vector will be returned.

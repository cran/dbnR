\title{Adds the mu vector and sigma matrix as attributes to the bn.fit or dbn.fit object}
\usage{
add_attr_to_fit(fit, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{a fitted bn or dbn}

\item{size}{number of time slices of the net}
}
\value{
the fitted net with attributes
}
\description{
Adds the mu vector and sigma matrix as attributes to the bn.fit or dbn.fit 
object to allow performing exact MVN inference on both cases. It also adds
the number of time slices of the net for future inference.

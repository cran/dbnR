degree(object, Nodes, ...)

\arguments{
\item{object}{a "bn", "dbn", "bn.fit" or "dbn.fit" object}

\item{Nodes}{which nodes to check}

\value{
the degree of the nodes

\description{
#' Generic method for calculating the degree of a list of nodes in a
BN or a DBN. Calls bnlearn's \code{\link{degree}} underneath. 
I have to redefine the generic and mask the original for it to work on both 
bn and dbn objects without the user having to import bnlearn.

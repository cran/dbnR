\title{Fold a dataset to a certain size and avoid overlapping of different time-series}
\usage{
filtered_fold_dt(dt, size, id_var, clear_id_var = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{data.table to be folded}

\item{size}{the size of the data.table}

\item{id_var}{the variable that labels each individual instance of the time-series}

\item{clear_id_var}{boolean that decides whether or not the id_var column is deleted}
}
\value{
the filtered dataset
}
\description{
If the dataset that is going to be folded contains several different time-series 
instances of the same process, folding it could introduce false rows with data
from different time-series. Given an id variable that labels the different 
instances of a time series inside a dataset and a desired size, this function 
folds the dataset and avoids mixing data from different origins in the same instance.

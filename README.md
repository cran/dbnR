## Introduction

This package offers an implementation of Gaussian dynamic Bayesian
networks (GDBN) structure learning and inference based partially on
Marco Scutari’s package bnlearn (<https://www.bnlearn.com/>). It also
allows the construction of higher-order DBNs. Three structure learning
algorithms are implemented:

- A variation on Ghada Trabelsi’s dynamic max-min hill climbing
  (<https://theses.hal.science/tel-00996061/document>).
- A particle swarm optimization algorithm for higher-order DBNs
  (<https://doi.org/10.1109/BRC.2014.6880957>)  
- A scalable, order invariant particle swarm optimization algorithm for
  higher-order DBNs
  (<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86271-8_14>)

Inference is performed either via the particle filtering offered by
bnlearn or by doing exact inference over the multivariate Gaussian
equivalent of a network implemented in this package. A visualization
tool is also implemented for GDBNs and bnlearn’s BNs via the visNetwork
package (<https://github.com/datastorm-open/visNetwork>).

## Current development

The main functionality of the package is running and working. In order
of importance, the next objectives are:

- To refractor the DMMHC algorithm into R6 for consistency with the
  PSOHO algorithm and with any new structure learning algorithms.
- To add an automatically generated shiny interface of the net. This
  makes interacting with the network easier and allows for simulation
  prototypes.

For now, the dbn.fit object as an extension of bnlearn’s bn.fit object
will stay the same except for the “mu” and “sigma” attributes added to
it. This way, it remains easy to call bnlearn’s methods on the dbn.fit
object and I can store the MVN transformation inside the same object.
Not an elegant solution, but its simplicity is enough. What should be
addressed is having to perform the folding of a dataset outside the
predict function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This package requires R ≥ 3.6.1 to work properly. It also works for R ≥
3.5.0, the only difference is the color palette of the DBN visualization
tool.

The **bnlearn** and **data.table** packages, among others, are required
for this package to work. They will be installed automatically when
installing this package. They can also be installed manually via CRAN
with the command

``` r
install.packages(c("bnlearn", "data.table"))
```

The packages **visNetwork**, **magrittr** and **grDevices** are optional
for the visualization tool. They will only be required if you want to
use it.

### Installing

As of today, the easiest way of installing dbnR is via CRAN. To install
it, simply run

``` r
install.packages('dbnR')
```

You can also install the latest version in GitHub with the
*install_github* function in the **devtools** package. The commands you
need to run are

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("dkesada/dbnR")
```

This will install the required dependencies if they are not available.
After this, you will be ready to use the package.

## Basic examples

To get the structure of a GDBN from a dataset, you need to use the
function *learn_dbn_struc*

``` r
library(dbnR)
#> Cargando paquete requerido: bnlearn
#> 
#> Adjuntando el paquete: 'dbnR'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:bnlearn':
#> 
#>     degree, nodes, nodes<-, score
```

``` r
data(motor)

size <- 3
dt_train <- motor[200:2500]
dt_val <- motor[2501:3000]
net <- learn_dbn_struc(dt_train, size)
```

The dt argument has to be either a data.frame or a data.table of numeric
columns, in the example we use the sample dataset included in the
package. The size argument determines the number of time slices that
your net is going to have, that is, the Markovian order of the net. A
Markovian order of 1 means that your data in the present is independent
of the past given the previous time slice. If your case doesn’t meet
this criteria, the size of the net can be increased, to take into
account more past time slices in the inference. In our function,
Markovian order = size - 1. The function returns a ‘dbn’ object that
inherits from the ‘bn’ class in *bnlearn*, so that its auxiliary
functions like ‘arcs’ and such also work on DBN structures.

Once the structure is learnt, it can be plotted and used to learn the
parameters

``` r
plot_dynamic_network(net)
```

</figure>

``` r
f_dt_train <- fold_dt(dt_train, size)
fit <- fit_dbn_params(net, f_dt_train, method = "mle-g")
```

After learning the net, two different types of inference can be
performed: point-wise inference over a dataset and forecasting to some
horizon. Point-wise inference uses the folded dt to try and predict the
objective variables in each row. Forecasting to some horizon, on the
other hand, tries to predict the behaviour in the future M instants
given some initial evidence of the variables.

There is an extensive example of how to use the package in the
*markdowns* folder, which covers more advanced concepts of structure
learning and inference.
